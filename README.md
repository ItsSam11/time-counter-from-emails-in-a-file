# time-counter-from-emails-in-a-file
This was one of my exercise from my data structure python class, the purpose was to create a program that read from a email file the following string structure 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008' and grab just the hour and count how many times was the hour in the entire file from the previous string structure, for this exercise I use list, dictionary, tuples and a little bit of list comprehension.
